- name: "You Are Not Stupid: Computers and Technology Simplified"

    My co-founder, Jack Stanley, and I wrote this book because we have the purpose to bridge the gap between people and technology.
    In today's world, we all use technology on a daily basis. Yet all too often, we do so with little understanding of how it works.
    The barriers to understanding the world of computers and tech are very real: how do these tiny devices work? What is a computer,
    actually? How can I learn the subject when it's riddled with complex technical jargon that no one seems to explain in a clear,
    simple way? We wanted to break down the subject so that anyone could understand it. Since we couldn't find any resource out there
    that did this well, we made it. If you have a friend or loved one who "just doesn't get computers," give them this book. It will
    change their life.
