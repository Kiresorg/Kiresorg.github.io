    I co-founded The Tech Academy, a very successful technology training company. The primary offerings 
    there are coding boot camps. I have been the senior technologist there since its inception, and 
    helped create every element of its curriculum. This comprises four six camp programs, each of which 
    has between 600-1200 hours of training. I've also created many advanced technology courses that 
    are used to train their instructors and in-house developers.

    My co-founder, Jack Stanley, and I wrote this book because we have the purpose to bridge the gap between people and technology.
    In today's world, we all use technology on a daily basis. Yet all too often, we do so with little understanding of how it works.
    The barriers to understanding the world of computers and tech are very real: how do these tiny devices work? What is a computer,
    actually? How can I learn the subject when it's riddled with complex technical jargon that no one seems to explain in a clear,
    simple way? We wanted to break down the subject so that anyone could understand it. Since we couldn't find any resource out there
    that did this well, we made it. If you have a friend or loved one who "just doesn't get computers," give them this book. It will
    change their life.
